Joy Doovision is a deeply inspired project based primarly on several songs from Joy Division, which
personally I love so much.
This project aims to reproduce some sort of punky-hopelessness vibe, with grinny maps, enemies and
all sorts of stuff that would drop players inside the "interness of hate", and also a very personal
interpretation of the message given by Ian Curtis words among songs.
I respect all kind of people, there won't be any reference concerning the "real Joy Division" thing
for what it was historically on WW2 (better not go on details with it), this project is just my kind
of "transposition from notes to maps" work and I am sure you'll be pleased by it.
Judging of the Atmosphere that I'll be use on this mod, please avoid it if you don't have a strong
enough mind or if you don't appreciate alternative ways to play Doom wads.
You'll understand what I mean once you'll play it. It will be guided by Autosuggestion.
